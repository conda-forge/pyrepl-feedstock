  summary: 'A library for building flexible command line interfaces'

  description: |
    pyrepl is a Python library, inspired by readline, for building flexible
    command line interfaces, featuring:

     * sane multi-line editing
     * history, with incremental search
     * completion, including displaying of available options
     * a fairly large subset of the readline emacs-mode keybindings
     * a liberal, Python-style, license
     * a new python top-level.
